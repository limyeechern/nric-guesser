   <h3>Imagine if you were doing a survey, and one of the questions innocently asks for your last 4 alphanumeric values of your NRIC, e.g. "123A", your age and birthdate/month, will your full NRIC still be a secret?</h3>
   <h3>Probably not, check this out, let me try to guess your NRIC in no more than 2 tries. (none of the data you will be sending is collected or cached)</h3>
