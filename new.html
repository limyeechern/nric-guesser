   <h3>Imagine if you were doing a survey, and one of the questions innocently asks for your last 4 alphanumeric values of your NRIC, e.g. "123A", and then your age and birthdate/month, will your full NRIC still be a secret?</h3>
   <h3>Probably not, check this out, let me try to guess your NRIC in no more than 2 tries. (none of the data you will send is collected or cached)</h3>

<div id="hidden_div" style="display:block">
<h3>
    <p>My best guess is {{result[0]}}</p>
    <p> My second guess is {{result[1]}}</p>
    <p>If I am wrong then that is good for you!</p>
    <p> Moral of the story: Don't give out your personal data so easily</p>
