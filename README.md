There is an almost complete explanation of the entire algorithm under main.py. If you are interested you can go and read and if I am wrong anywhere please feel free to chat with me so I can amend the mistakes.

## Hosting
The website is hosted at : https://nric-guesser-wtbmcdtuva-as.a.run.app/ Users can input 4 alphanumerics, their year and month of birth to see if the algorithm manages to guess their full NRIC

The website aims to guess your NRIC, given your last 4 alphanumerics and your birthdate information. Although these information together provide substantial information of your NRIC, there are still 2 digits left that are not given. Given your last 4 alphanumerics, an individual may easily obtain your age and birth month through social media. Therefore, this aims to highlight the importance of our individual data. None of the data a user will be sending is collected nor stored.
